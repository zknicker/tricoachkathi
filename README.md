TriCoachKathi Website
=============

TriCoachKathi.com is a website I developed for an Oak Park, Michigan located triathalon coaching business. The website graciously uses the "Spasalon" WordPress theme found here: http://wordpress.org/themes/spasalon. It has been customized somewhat heavily to give it a bit of a custom flare. However, the modifications were made with some rather strict time and budget constraints in mind. As a result, said changes are as simple and succinct as possible.
